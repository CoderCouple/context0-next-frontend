## Features

### Persistent Memory
ChatGPT will remember:
- Your personal preferences and interests
- Professional background and expertise
- Past project discussions and decisions
- Important dates and commitments
- Conversation history and context

### Smart Context Injection
The integration automatically:
- Analyzes your current conversation
- Finds relevant memories from your knowledge base
- Injects contextual information seamlessly
- Maintains conversation flow and naturalness

### Memory Management
Direct memory control within ChatGPT:
- Add new memories during conversations
- Edit existing memories inline
- Delete outdated or incorrect information
- Organize memories with tags and categories

## How It Works

### Automatic Context Detection

When you start a conversation, Context Zero AI:

1. **Analyzes Your Message**: Understanding intent and context
2. **Searches Memory Graph**: Finding relevant connected memories
3. **Ranks Relevance**: Scoring memories by importance and recency
4. **Injects Context**: Adding background information to the conversation

### Example Conversation

**Without Context Zero AI:**
```
User: How should I approach the client meeting?
ChatGPT: I'd recommend preparing an agenda, researching the client, and 
defining clear objectives for the meeting.
```

**With Context Zero AI:**
```
User: How should I approach the client meeting?

Context Zero AI injects:
- Client: TechCorp (previous meetings on 2/15, 3/22)
- Project: Mobile app redesign (budget: $50k, timeline: 8 weeks)
- Key contacts: Sarah (CTO), Mike (PM) - both prefer technical details
- Last discussion: Concerns about React Native performance

ChatGPT: Based on your previous meetings with TechCorp, I'd recommend 
focusing on addressing Sarah and Mike's React Native performance concerns. 
Since they appreciate technical details, prepare specific metrics from 
your mobile app redesign project. Given the $50k budget and 8-week 
timeline you discussed, consider proposing a phased approach...
```

## Configuration

### Memory Scope Settings

Control which memories are shared with ChatGPT:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Personal Only">
    ```json
    {
      "scope": "personal",
      "include_categories": [
        "preferences",
        "experiences", 
        "goals"
      ],
      "exclude_sensitive": true
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Professional Only">
    ```json
    {
      "scope": "professional", 
      "include_categories": [
        "work",
        "projects",
        "clients",
        "skills"
      ],
      "exclude_personal": true
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Everything">
    ```json
    {
      "scope": "all",
      "include_categories": ["*"],
      "apply_privacy_filters": true,
      "max_context_length": 2000
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Privacy Controls

Fine-tune what information is shared:

- **Sensitive Information Filter**: Automatically excludes personal data
- **Category Blocking**: Disable specific memory categories
- **Temporary Disable**: Pause memory injection for sensitive conversations
- **Manual Override**: Approve/reject each memory suggestion

### Performance Settings

Optimize the integration for your needs:

- **Context Length**: Limit how much background information is included
- **Relevance Threshold**: Control minimum relevance score for memory injection
- **Update Frequency**: Set how often memories are refreshed
- **Cache Duration**: Configure how long context is cached locally

## Advanced Features

### Conversation Memory

Every ChatGPT conversation can be automatically saved as a memory:

```python
# Automatic conversation saving
{
  "content": "Discussed marketing strategy for Q4. Decided to focus on social media campaigns and influencer partnerships. Budget allocated: $25k.",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "conversation",
    "source": "chatgpt", 
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "participants": ["user", "chatgpt"],
    "topics": ["marketing", "q4", "budget"]
  }
}
```

### Smart Suggestions

Get proactive memory suggestions during conversations:

- **Related Topics**: "You might want to mention your experience with React from last month"
- **Follow-ups**: "Remember to ask about the client's feedback on the prototype"
- **Connections**: "This relates to your conversation with Sarah about API design"

### Multi-Session Context

Maintain context across multiple ChatGPT sessions:

- **Project Continuity**: Pick up where you left off on projects
- **Learning Progress**: Track your learning journey and progress
- **Decision History**: Remember past decisions and their outcomes
- **Relationship Building**: Maintain context about people and relationships

## API Integration

For advanced users, integrate ChatGPT programmatically:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from contextzero import ContextZero
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize clients
context_client = ContextZero(api_key="your_context_zero_key")
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="your_openai_key")

def enhanced_chat(user_message):
    # Get relevant context
    context = context_client.memories.search(
        query=user_message,
        limit=5
    )
    
    # Build enhanced prompt
    system_prompt = "Relevant context:\n" + "\n".join([
        f"- {memory.content}" for memory in context
    ])
    
    # Send to ChatGPT
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
        ]
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { ContextZero } from '@contextzero/sdk';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

const contextClient = new ContextZero({ apiKey: process.env.CONTEXT_ZERO_API_KEY });
const openaiClient = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

async function enhancedChat(userMessage) {
    // Get relevant context
    const context = await contextClient.memories.search({
        query: userMessage,
        limit: 5
    });
    
    // Build enhanced prompt
    const systemPrompt = "Relevant context:\n" + 
        context.map(memory => `- ${memory.content}`).join('\n');
    
    // Send to ChatGPT
    const response = await openaiClient.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'gpt-4',
        messages: [
            { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
            { role: 'user', content: userMessage }
        ]
    });
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```
