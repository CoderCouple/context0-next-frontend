## What are Memories?

Memories in Context Zero AI are structured pieces of information that capture and store personal context, experiences, and knowledge. They serve as the foundation for personalized AI interactions by providing relevant context when needed.

## Memory Structure

Each memory consists of several key components:

## Memory Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
Memories are created through various methods:
- Direct API calls
- Browser extension capture
- Import from external sources
- Automatic extraction from conversations

### 2. Storage
Memories are stored with:
- End-to-end encryption
- Distributed redundancy
- Version control
- Backup and recovery

### 3. Indexing
Upon storage, memories are:
- Vectorized using state-of-the-art embeddings
- Indexed for fast retrieval
- Connected to related memories
- Categorized automatically

### 4. Retrieval
Memories are retrieved based on:
- Semantic similarity
- Contextual relevance
- Recency and frequency
- User preferences

## Best Practices

### Memory Quality
- **Be Specific**: Include relevant details and context
- **Use Clear Language**: Write memories in clear, understandable language
- **Add Metadata**: Use tags and categories for better organization
- **Regular Updates**: Keep memories current and accurate

### Organization
- **Consistent Categorization**: Use standardized categories
- **Meaningful Tags**: Apply relevant and searchable tags
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related memories together
- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove outdated or irrelevant memories

### Privacy and Security
- **Sensitive Information**: Be cautious with personal or confidential data
- **Access Control**: Use appropriate permissions and sharing settings
- **Regular Audits**: Review and update memory permissions periodically

## Advanced Features

### Memory Compression
Context Zero AI automatically compresses similar memories to:
- Reduce storage overhead
- Improve retrieval efficiency
- Maintain semantic coherence
- Preserve important details

### Temporal Decay
Memories have built-in temporal characteristics:
- Recent memories have higher retrieval priority
- Frequently accessed memories gain importance
- Unused memories gradually fade in priority
- Important memories can be pinned to prevent decay

### Cross-Memory Relationships
Memories can be connected through:
- **Semantic Similarity**: Content-based relationships
- **Temporal Proximity**: Time-based connections  
- **User-Defined Links**: Manual associations
- **Contextual Relevance**: Situation-based connections
