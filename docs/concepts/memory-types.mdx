Context Zero AI supports various types of memories, each designed for specific use cases and interaction patterns. Understanding these types helps you organize and retrieve information more effectively.

## Personal Memories

Personal memories capture individual preferences, experiences, and characteristics.

### Profile Information

  "metadata": {
    "type": "profile",
    "category": "personal",
    "tags": ["career", "skills", "experience"]
  }
}
```

### Preferences
User preferences and choices:

```json
{
  "content": "I prefer dark mode interfaces and minimal design aesthetics. I also like my coffee black.",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "preference", 
    "category": "personal",
    "tags": ["ui", "design", "coffee"]
  }
}
```

### Experiences

}
```

## Knowledge Memories

Knowledge memories store factual information, concepts, and learned material.

    "tags": ["planning", "q4", "metrics"]
  }
}
```

### Environmental Context

## Advanced Memory Features

### Automatic Classification
Context Zero AI automatically suggests memory types based on content:
- Natural language processing
- Pattern recognition
- Context analysis
- User behavior learning

### Type-Specific Retrieval
Different memory types have optimized retrieval patterns:
- Personal memories prioritize recency
- Knowledge memories focus on relevance
- Task memories consider deadlines
- Relationship memories use connection strength

### Cross-Type Relationships
Memories can span multiple types and create rich contextual networks:
- A project memory might reference team members
- A task memory might relate to personal goals
- Knowledge memories can inform experiences

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Type
1. **Consider the Primary Purpose**: What is the main use of this information?
2. **Think About Retrieval**: When and how will you need this memory?
3. **Plan for Relationships**: How might this connect to other memories?
4. **Consider Longevity**: How long will this information remain relevant?

### Metadata Optimization
- Use consistent tag vocabularies
- Include relevant temporal information
- Add priority or importance indicators
- Specify relationships explicitly
